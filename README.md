# React-Webpack-Template

This is a very basic template that can be forked for React development. It includes the following (also checkout the package.json and wepback.config for details). I'm still learning so feedback is always welcome :).

* react
* react-dom
* react-dom-router
* webpack
  * babel
  * clean-webpack
  * html-webpack
  * dev-server
  * splitChunks
